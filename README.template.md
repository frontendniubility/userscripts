# Userscripts

Various userscripts maintained by webpack, and also hosted on this repository.
if you want to add a new script, just need 2 steps, first, fork this repository then secondly add folder in the `src`,  then edit your userscipt(the extension should be `.user.js` or `.user.es6` or `.user.mjs` ) , if you debug or release your scripts, you need run command -  `npm run start` or `npm run build` .

This repository is inspired by [userscript](https://github.com/fuzetsu/userscripts) and [webpack-userscript](https://github.com/momocow/webpack-userscript).

You can install the script here on github to always have the latest development version (links below).
