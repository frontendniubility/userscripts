# [Desktop Notifications for Hangouts Web](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/14193-hangouts-notifier)

**NOTE:** hangouts has changed and this script does not currently work, may come
back and fix it at some point.

Hangouts doesn't seem to show desktop notifications for the web app integrated 
into inbox, gmail, google plus and the hangouts site itself so this userscript 
implements that.
