# [Hummingbird Compatibility Hover](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9570-hummingbird-compatibility-hover)

A quick and convenient way to see the compatibility between yourself and 
another Hummingbird.me user. It shows the compatibility rating calculated 
[here](https://fuzetsu.github.io/hummingbird-user-compare).

Also check out [the official discussion thread](https://forums.hummingbird.me/t/web-hummingbird-user-comparison-and-compatibility/23976).

Another useful userscript in the same vein is 
[Hummingbird User Compare](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5680-hummingbird-user-compare), 
it adds a compare button to user's pages and embeds the compatibility percentage.
