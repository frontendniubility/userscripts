# [Youtube History Management](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/7044-youtube-history-management)

This script helps you delete YouTube history items more easily. With it you can 
select a number of history items and then delete them all once.

Supports using the `SHIFT` key to select a range of history items.

Holding the `SHIFT` key and clicking on an item will select every item above 
it up until the last selected item or the top, whichever comes first.

Click the "Edit History" button to start and then click any of the history 
items to highlight them for removal.
